# Culture insights in the Edo period of Japan

This visualization provides a clarification of Japanese articles in the Edo period. This imperial period takes place from 1600 to 1868 in Japan. The objects are displayed scattered on a timeline and arranged in the Early, Middle or Late Edo period. The various emperors who have ruled in this period will also be indicated on this timeline. In this way the users can clearly see from which government period the various objects come. The timeline can be used interactively because a time period can be clicked and the Japanese objects will come forward that belong to this period.

The whole process that I made within this project will all be documented in the [wiki](https://github.com/RooyyDoe/frontend-applications/wiki) of my repository
