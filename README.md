# Culture insights in the Edo period of Japan

This visualization provides a clarification of Japanese articles in the Edo period. This imperial period takes place from 1600 to 1868 in Japan. The objects are displayed scattered on a timeline and arranged in the Early, Middle or Late Edo period. The various emperors who have ruled in this period will also be indicated on this timeline. In this way the users can clearly see from which government period the various objects come. The timeline can be used interactively because a time period can be clicked and the Japanese objects will come forward that belong to this period.

The whole process that I made within this project will all be documented in the [wiki](https://github.com/RooyyDoe/frontend-applications/wiki) of my repository

## Assignment

In this front-end course I needed to create a client-side application in JavaScript which dynamically renders data to views using either a front-end framework or system created by you. Reflect on the merits and costs of frameworks together.

## Installation

**Clone the repository of the project**
```
git clone https://github.com/RooyyDoe/frontend-applications.git
```

**Npm packages installing**
```
npm install
```

## Usage

**Run code**
```
npm run dev
```

**Url for the application**

```
localhost:5000 // host is now available
```

## API
I made use of the following API:

* [GVN](https://data.netwerkdigitaalerfgoed.nl/)

```
API QUERY *Loading....*
```

This API allows you to get data of different historical events. This can be objects or pictures but also events that happend in the history. We have all gotten an invidual endpoint to use this database.
